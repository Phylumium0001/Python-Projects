## **9. Expense Tracker with SQL Database**

- **Background**: An expense tracker is a tool that helps users track their daily, weekly, or monthly expenses and categorizes them (e.g., food, entertainment, rent, etc.). By saving this data in a database, users can later retrieve and analyze their spending habits. This project helps in understanding how to work with databases using Python, particularly SQL databases such as SQLite.

- **Prompt**: 
  - **Input/Output**: Users should be able to enter details of their expenses (e.g., amount, category, date, description) and store this information in an SQL database. They should also be able to query the database to retrieve expense reports or view total spending by category or date range.
  
  - **Database Design**: 
    - A simple SQL table might have fields like `id`, `amount`, `category`, `date`, and `description`.
    - For example:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE expenses (
          id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
          amount REAL,
          category TEXT,
          date TEXT,
          description TEXT
      );
      ```
  - **Features**:
    1. **Add Expense**: Let users add new expenses by entering the amount, category (e.g., groceries, transportation), date, and an optional description.
    2. **View Expenses**: Display all expenses in a list or table. Include filters such as by date range, category, or specific amounts.
    3. **Edit/Delete Expenses**: Allow users to update or delete previously added expenses.
    4. **Reports**: Provide basic reporting functionality such as:
        - Total expenses over a specific time period.
        - Expenses by category (e.g., total spent on groceries in the last month).
        - Plot graphs using libraries like `matplotlib` to visualize spending trends.

- **Implementation Tips**:
  - **SQL Integration**: Use Python’s `sqlite3` library to interact with a local SQL database. You can also use `SQLAlchemy` for a higher-level ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
  - **Data Validation**: Ensure valid data is entered by users (e.g., a positive amount, valid date format).
  - **Command Line or GUI**: You could either keep the interface command-line-based or, for more advanced practice, build a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter` or `Flask` if you want it web-based.
  
  - **Example Workflow**:
    1. User adds an expense: `$ 20 for lunch on October 23, 2024.`
    2. Data gets saved in the database under the `category` "Food".
    3. Later, the user retrieves a report for October 2024 and sees that they spent `$ 60` on food.
    4. A graph is displayed showing the breakdown of spending by category for the month.

- **Stretch Features**:
    - **Exporting Data**: Add functionality to export expenses and reports into CSV or Excel format.
    - **Income Tracking**: Track income as well and calculate the balance between income and expenses.
    - **Budget Alerts**: Allow users to set a budget for certain categories (e.g., $200 for food) and notify them when they are close to exceeding it.
