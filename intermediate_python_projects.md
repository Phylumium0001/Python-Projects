## 2. Binary Search Algorithm Visualization
- **Background**: Implement a binary search on a sorted list and visualize the search process.
- **Prompt**: Create a function to visualize how binary search splits the list into halves and narrows down to find the target number. You can either print the list or plot it using `matplotlib`.

## 3. Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)
- **Background**: Implement a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where one player is an AI using the minimax algorithm.
- **Prompt**: Build a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against the computer, which makes optimal moves using the minimax algorithm to guarantee at least a tie.

## 4. File Organizer Script
- **Background**: Write a Python script that automatically organizes files in a directory based on their file types (e.g., images, documents, videos).
- **Prompt**: Use the `os` and `shutil` libraries to move files into respective folders (e.g., `.jpg` and `.png` to “Images,” `.txt` and `.pdf` to “Documents”).

## 5. Data Visualization: COVID-19 Case Trends
- **Background**: Fetch data from an API (such as COVID-19 case statistics) and create a data visualization using `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.
- **Prompt**: Pull real-time COVID-19 case data (using a free API like `covid19api`) and visualize the trends over time. Include options for users to select a specific country or region.

## 6. URL Shortener Service
- **Background**: Create a basic URL shortener like TinyURL using Python.
- **Prompt**: Allow users to input a long URL, and generate a shorter, unique URL using hash functions or random strings. Maintain a database (or simple file storage) to store the mappings between short and long URLs.

## 7. Markdown to HTML Converter
- **Background**: Write a program that converts basic Markdown syntax (headers, bold, italics, lists, etc.) into HTML.
- **Prompt**: Parse a `.md` file and convert it into HTML, handling common Markdown elements like `#` for headers, `*` for bold/italic, and `-` for lists.

## 8. Real-Time Chat Application (Socket Programming)
- **Background**: Build a simple real-time chat application using Python’s `socket` library.
- **Prompt**: Implement a server that can handle multiple clients and allow them to send and receive messages in real-time. Focus on setting up multi-threading for handling clients concurrently.

## 9. Expense Tracker with SQL Database
- **Background**: Build an expense tracker where users can add expenses and categorize them, saving the data to an SQL database.
- **Prompt**: Use `sqlite3` or `SQLAlchemy` to store expenses and retrieve reports. Include features like filtering expenses by date, category, and generating summary reports.

## 10. Web Scraper with Pagination and Caching
- **Background**: Write a scraper that handles paginated content (e.g., scraping products from multiple pages of an e-commerce website) and caches the results.
- **Prompt**: Use `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` to scrape multiple pages, then implement caching with `sqlite3` or a simple JSON file to avoid re-scraping unchanged pages.

## 11. Flask Blog with User Authentication
- **Background**: Build a blogging platform using Flask, where users can register, log in, and create posts.
- **Prompt**: Implement user authentication using `Flask-Login` or JWT, allowing users to register, log in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their posts. Use SQL to store user data and posts.

## 12. Conway’s Game of Life
- **Background**: Implement Conway’s Game of Life, a cellular automaton where cells live or die based on their neighbors.
- **Prompt**: Create a 2D grid where each cell can either be alive or dead. Use the rules of the game to determine whether a cell lives, dies, or reproduces in each iteration, and visualize the game state using `matplotlib` or `pygame`.

## 13. Sudoku Solver (With GUI)
- **Background**: Write a Sudoku solver that allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle and find the solution using backtracking.
- **Prompt**: Create a GUI for users to input the puzzle using `tkinter` or `pygame`, then implement backtracking to find the solution. Display the solved puzzle in the GUI.

## 14. Pygame Platformer
- **Background**: Create a simple 2D platformer game using `pygame`.
- **Prompt**: Implement basic platformer mechanics like jumping, moving left/right, and collision detection. Add some enemies and levels to make the game more interesting.

## 15. Text-Based RPG (Role-Playing Game)
- **Background**: Build a text-based RPG where players can fight enemies, collect loot, and level up.
- **Prompt**: Design a basic turn-based combat system where players can attack enemies and use items. Create a leveling system where stats increase as players defeat enemies.

## 16. Minesweeper Game
- **Background**: Implement the Minesweeper game where users click on cells to reveal whether they contain a mine or not.
- **Prompt**: Create a 2D grid of cells, some of which contain mines. Users click on cells to reveal whether it’s a mine. Use a GUI library like `tkinter` or `pygame` to handle input and display.

## 17. Weather Dashboard with API Integration
- **Background**: Build a dashboard that displays the weather of a selected city using a weather API.
- **Prompt**: Fetch weather data from an API like OpenWeatherMap and display it in a simple dashboard. Include features like selecting cities, showing the current weather, and displaying forecasts.

## 18. File Compression (Huffman Encoding)
- **Background**: Implement the Huffman coding algorithm to compress text files.
- **Prompt**: Create a program that reads a text file, builds a frequency table, and generates Huffman codes to compress the file. Then, allow the user to decompress the file back to its original form.

## 19. Regex-Based Text Search Tool
- **Background**: Create a command-line tool that uses regular expressions to search for patterns in text files.
- **Prompt**: Allow users to input a regex pattern and a file, then search through the file to find all matches. Extend it by allowing the user to replace the matches with new text.

## 20. API Rate Limiter
- **Background**: Design a simple API rate-limiter using Python to control the number of requests a user can make to an API.
- **Prompt**: Build a rate-limiter that tracks the number of API calls made by a user in a time window (e.g., 10 requests per minute). Use Redis or an in-memory structure like dictionaries to keep track of the counts.
